					<p>If you have a dynamic WordPress site, regular maintenance is an absolute necessity. With this add-on, I will make future updates, perform WordPress and plugin upgrades as new versions become available, and backup your site regularly.

					Simple updates to your website (font change, color changes, etc.) can take 2 to 3 days to complete. Larger changes (responsive, template chages, etc.) can take up to 1 week or more, depending on what changes you want to make. 

					I offer hourly, weekly, and monthly maintenance add-ons, depending on how often you need changes/updates/upgrades and what you would like.</p>
